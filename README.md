# ML Course Final Project - Gesture Control Game

This project implements a gesture-controlled game using machine learning for gesture recognition. Players can control the game using hand gestures captured through their webcam.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code:
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Live Server"
   - Install the extension by Ritwick Dey

2. Launch the project:
   - Right-click on `index.html`
   - Select "Open with Live Server"
   - The game should open in your default browser at `http://localhost:5500`

## 🎮 Controls

The game can be controlled through:
- Hand gestures (via webcam)
- Keyboard arrows (as fallback)
## Model:
the xgboost model has shown a staggering 99% accuracy after fine-tuning using optuna and so it was chosen as the model to use for this projecct.
